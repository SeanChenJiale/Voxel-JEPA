        "This notebook shows how to fine-tune a pre-trained Vision model for Video Classification on a custom dataset. The idea is to add a randomly initialized classification head on top of a pre-trained encoder and fine-tune the model altogether on a labeled dataset.\n",

        "This notebook uses a subset of the [UCF-101 dataset](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php). We'll be using a subset of the dataset to keep the runtime of the tutorial short. The subset was prepared using [this notebook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tTScjnyiKrBz84jKe1H_hPGGXffAZuxX/view?usp=sharing) following [this guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/video).\n",

You can find the other variants of VideoMAE available on 🤗 Hub [here](https://huggingface.co/models?search=videomae). You can also extend this notebook to use other video models such as [X-CLIP](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/xclip#transformers.XCLIPVisionModel).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note** that for models where there's no classification head already available you'll have to manually attach it (randomly initialized). But this is not the case for VideoMAE since we already have a [`VideoMAEForVideoClassification`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/xclip#transformers.XCLIPVisionModel) class.\n",

        "This notebook leverages [TorchVision's](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/transforms.html) and [PyTorchVideo's](https://pytorchvideo.org/) transforms for applying data preprocessing transformations including data augmentation.\n",

        "Depending on the model and the GPU you are using, you might need to adjust the batch size to avoid out-of-memory errors. Set those two parameters, then the rest of the notebook should run smoothly."

We're using the [`pytorchvideo.data.Ucf101()`](https://pytorchvideo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/data/data.html#pytorchvideo.data.Ucf101) function because it's tailored for the UCF-101 dataset. Under the hood, it returns a [`pytorchvideo.data.labeled_video_dataset.LabeledVideoDataset`](https://pytorchvideo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/data/data.html#pytorchvideo.data.LabeledVideoDataset) object. `LabeledVideoDataset` class is the base class for all things video in the PyTorch Video dataset. So, if you wanted to use a custom dataset not supported off-the-shelf by PyTorch Video, you can extend the `LabeledVideoDataset` class accordingly. Refer to the `data` API [documentation to](https://pytorchvideo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/data/data.html) learn more. Also, if your dataset follows a similar structure (as shown above), then using the `pytorchvideo.data.Ucf101()` should work just fine."
